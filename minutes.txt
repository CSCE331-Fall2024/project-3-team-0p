factor authentication but then realized that it was wrong. Judy was working on getting the weather API as well as
completed making all the HTML files for the manager interface. She is struggling with figuring out how APIs work and
how to call it so that it displays on the screen. Layla worked on showing the current meal at all times for the customer.
She wants to make a change to it so that every entree shows up as the user clicks. Right now it is showing after all the
entrees have finished. Alana worked on displaying the employee table to display employee information for the manager. She

Minutes:
Alana completed the manager employee on the manager interface. She found difficulty in retrieving the username for all the
changing manager employees and putting it in SQL commands. Ian integrated the google translate API. His main struggles were
getting everything to still work after it got translated. At first translating pages messed up the formatting of the HTML
files so he had to get the script to loop through each page and properly translate everything.  Judy finished the manager
prices page and the weather API. Her main difficulty was getting the table to display in the manager price section. She
realized that she forgot to call the table, so calling it fixed that problem. She also struggled with figuring out how to
get all the values to display for the weather API in the manager statistics page. Layla completed the manager meals
interface where the manager can add and remove meals. She also fixed the button placement on the customer review order and
display meal pages. She had difficulty with making the table for the manager meal page fit properly on the page.
